# Everyday Design Patterns: Facade Pattern

## Talk Description

Healthcare organizations generate and store vast amounts of data, but accessing and utilizing this data can be a challenge. One solution to this problem is FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), a standard for exchanging electronic health information. In this talk, we will explore the basics of FHIR and its data model, as well as how to use Python to interact with FHIR servers and manipulate FHIR data. We will also discuss real-world examples of how FHIR and Python are being used in the healthcare industry to improve patient care and drive innovation. Attendees will come away with a solid understanding of FHIR and Python, and be equipped to start using these technologies to unlock the power of their own health data.
