# Web 1.0 and Python

## Submission Type

Thunder Talk (10 minutes)

## Description

> Please enter a short description of the talk to be used on the schedule and talk detail pages of the PyOhio website. This content will be shown publicly.

The days of Web 1.0 were a simpler time: static pages, CGI scripts, and deprecated HTML tags like `<blink>` and `<marqueee>`. This talk will take a trip down memory lane and demonstrate how to use Python to design websites like it's 1999.

## Notes

> These notes are meant for the organizers and won't be made public.

I had no idea that [cgi support is in the Python Stanard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cgi.html) was a thing. After spending a couple of hours doing preliminary research, I can confidently say that I can use Python + HTML to build a Web 1.0 site with a Geocities aesthetic.

On top of being a regular speaker in the Chicago tech community, I have also spoken at PyTexas, PyTennessee, and led a 3-hour tutorial at PyCon US. A selection of previous talks can be viewed at https://bit.ly/siv-talks-playlist

## Talk Objective

> What is your desired takeaway for the audience?

My goal is to make a light-hearted talk where the audience has fun, feels a sense of nostalia, and learns how we got from Web 1.0 to Web 3.0.
