Finite State Machines (FSM) are tools we can use to model simple and complex workflows. In this (non-mathematical) talk, we will learn about FSMs and examine how they can be used to improve software design. Weâ€™ll finish by diving deep into a couple of Python implementations of FSMs.

Full disclosure: one of the implementations is a library I created.
