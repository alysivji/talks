## Thoughts

- programming is 5% programming, 95% debugging
- being able to figure out what's up is a useful skill

- we should teach debugging first
- how much of programming is debugging and how much of it is programming

### How to Debug

- best way to debug is not to have bugs
- bad implemtnation can be googled
- bad algorithms usually cannot
- what are you not understanding?
- what tools can we use?
- don't start with a solution
- start by truly understanding the problem

Take the Udacity debugging course
