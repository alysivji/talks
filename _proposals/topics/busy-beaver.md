# Busy Beaver

All talks related to Busy Beaver, the Chicago Python Community Engagement Slack bot.

## Introducing Busy Beaver

With over four thousand members, the Chicago Python Users Group is one of the largest Python communities in the world. Slack has become the primary method of communication amongst members in-between events. We developed an open-source Slack bot, codename: Busy Beaver, to increase member engagement.

This talk will introduce Busy Beaver, provide a high-level walkthrough of its architecture and code, and discuss the future roadmap of the project.

## Lightning Talk

The Chicago Python User Group (ChiPy) is one of the largest tech-focused communities in the United States. ChiPy leverages Slack as our primary communication platform in-between events. While we use various Slack integrations, nothing in the App Marketplace fit our specific needs. We formed a team and developed a Slack bot, codename: Busy Beaver, to increase member engagement. An open-source community has grown around Busy Beaver with developers from around the world making contributions to our local user group.

## Busy Beaver: Idea to Execution

The Chicago Python User Group (ChiPy) is one of the largest tech-focused communities in the United States. We use Slack to continue conversations and develop relationships in-between our group’s weekly events. ChiPy developed an open-source community engagement Slack bot, codename: Busy Beaver, that integrates with various third-party APIs to better serve members of our hyperlocal, niche workspace. Users can find information about upcoming events; view feeds from our social media channels; and gain insights into other members’ side projects. An open-source community has developed around Busy Beaver with developers from around the world making contributions to our Slack integration.

This talk will introduce Busy Beaver; dig into architecture and code; examine the future roadmap of the project; and discuss the challenges of building a project in public.

(PyCon Africa talk)

The Chicago Python Users Group (ChiPy) is one of the largest Python communities in the world with close to 6,000 members! Slack has become our primary way of communicating with our members; the platform has been especially vital during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2019, ChiPy created an open-source Slack bot to automate workflows to increase community engagement. Users can find information about upcoming events; view feeds from our social media channels; and gain insights into other members’ side projects. An open-source community has developed around Busy Beaver with developers from around the world making contributions to our custom application!

This talk will introduce Busy Beaver and discuss why we created a custom integration. We will dig into the product development process, conduct a retrospective, and examine the future roadmap of the project
