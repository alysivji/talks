# Everyday Design Patterns: Observer Pattern

## Description

The Observer Pattern enables us to design event-driven systems using loosely coupled components. In this talk, we will learn how, when, and why to use this pattern; we will explore how popular PyPI packages use the pattern; and, we will design a decorator-based Observer to process Slack events.

## What will attendees learn

This session is geared towards intermediate and advanced developers looking for a friendly and practical approach to Design Patterns. By applying the principles outlined in this talk, attendees will be able to use the Observer Pattern to create loosely coupled components that are easy to modify and even easier to test.

## Notes

I have experience in giving talks on applied Object-Oriented Principles. I have given a talk on how if statements can be refactored into polymorphic classes (PyCon 2020, PyCon Balkan 2019, PyOhio 2019). Have also given a talk on the Facade Design Pattern (PyTennessee 2020, PyTexas 2020).

On top of being a regular speaker in the Chicago tech community, I have also spoken at PyCon Africa, EuroPython, and led a 3-hour tutorial at PyCon US. A selection of previous talks can be viewed at https://bit.ly/siv-talks-playlist
