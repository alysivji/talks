## Elevator Pitch

Developers spend lots of time writing code to integrate third-party packages and APIs into our project. We spend additional time updating systems when our dependencies change. This talk demonstrates HOWTO leverage the Facade Pattern to hide complexity and isolate the impact of changes.

## Description

Developers spend lots of time writing code to integrate third-party packages and APIs into our project. Directly adding dependencies into business logic couples our code to something we do not control. This makes code hard to modify and even harder to test. Changes made to upstream packages require us to update integration code across the project.

This talk demonstrates HOWTO use Object-Oriented programming principles, specifically abstraction and encapsulation, to hide complexity and isolate the impact of changes. By using an API version upgrade as our guiding example, we will: walk through the initial implementation, discuss its limitations, and show how the Facade Pattern improves software design.

The session is geared towards developers of all levels looking for a friendlier approach to Design Patterns. By applying the principles outlined, you will be able to use the Facade pattern to write robust code that is easy to maintain.

### Outline

- Introduction to topic and speaker (2 minutes)
- Design Patterns Introduction (3 minutes)
    - What are design patterns?
    - Benefits of patterns
    - Types of Patterns: Creational, Structural, Behavioral
- Case Study: Interacting with APIs (5 minutes)
    - Introduce problem -- downloading data from 3rd party API
    - Walk thru initial solution (direct integration)
    - API changes...!!! Changing our code is painful!
    - Aside: tests are complicated to write
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (5 minutes)
    - High-level intro
    - Principles of OOP
    - Dive into encapsulation and abstraction
    - Encapsulation and abstraction in Python
- Case Study Revisited: Facade Pattern (8 minutes)
    - Adding a layer between the API and implementation enables changes to be isolated
    - Walk through the process of changing code to support new API
    - Show how facade pattern simplifies testing with fakes
    - Other examples of Facade pattern in practice: wrap Python libraries
- Closing (2 minutes)
    - Benefits of Design Patterns
    - Program to an interface, not an implementation
    - Don't get too hung up on diagrams and terminology
    - Focus on understanding the problem you are trying to solve

## Notes

I will be presenting this talk at PyTennessee in March 2020. I have previously given a lightning talk about the Facade Pattern at a Chicago Python meetup.

I have experience in breaking down complex concepts into easily understood components. I recently gave a talk on how if statements can be refactored into polymorphism classes at PyCon Balkan. The audience appreciated the use of a real-world code example to help solidify abstract object-oriented concepts.

On top of being a regular speaker in the Chicago tech community, I have also spoken at PyOhio, PyTexas, and led a 3-hour tutorial at PyCon US. A selection of previous talks can be viewed at https://bit.ly/siv-talks-playlist
